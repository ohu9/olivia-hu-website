Hey there! I'm Olivia, a CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in AI and media technologies.

After a few years of learning and exploration I've shifted my focus towards the public-facing aspects of software development. I've perhaps romanticized the art of conveying developers' work to users via seamless UI, but I do think I've found a rather sweet spot in this versatile field, marrying my technical education and affinity for design.
My main strength lies in the interdisciplinary experience I bring to the table. I've entertained and explored many interests throughout my education so far &mdash; psychology, education, illustration, graphic design, writing &amp; publication, etc. &mdash; which allow me to design and implement with a more extensive and contextualized understanding of my task.
I also bring thoroughness: though I'm fairly detail-oriented, I find that a comprehensive understanding of the systems I'm using allows me to produce more conscientious and compatible work. That's why I chose full-stack development &mdash; there's nothing more gratifying than seeing all parts of an application work smoothly together.

Outside all these credentials, I enjoy running, reading, journaling, and playing piano/guitar. I'm an avid podcast-listener and I've been getting into pickleball &mdash; just, you know, trying to touch some grass... I also lead a small group at my campus fellowship, and I find myself most fulfilled spending time with &amp; serving others. 
Woa thanks for reading all this &amp; enjoy the rest of the site! :&#41;
